## Data Modelling and relationships

Key dimensions for breaking down the analysis were identified, additional features were created to give more robustness to our analysis
The data model was designed using the Star Schema where the different dimensions were connected to the Facts table in a one-to-many relationship.

## Create visualizations and charts:
Appropriate chart types (e.g., Clustered column charts, line charts, pie charts) were used to represent the metrics and insights. Interactive features such as filters were used for detailed information.
